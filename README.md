### Generating a set of points satisfying the Mandelbrot set equation
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  `mandelbrot_set.py` script generates the geometrical fractal (set of points in a complex plane spread out according to an algorithm) of a Mandelbrot set given by the formula: 
  * `Zn+1 = Zn^2 + c, Z0 = c`, where Z is a complex number of the form `x+iy`
2.  Simply to put, Mandelbrot set is a set of all `c`'s such that a corresponding Zn doesn't touch infinity when n -> infinity.
3.  Images ![mandelbrot1](https://github.com/ashishraste/mandelbrots/blob/master/mandelbrot_fractal1.png) and ![mandelbrot2](https://github.com/ashishraste/mandelbrots/blob/master/mandelbrot_fractal1.png) are the fractals(with different coloring pattern) obtained by applying the above formula.
3.  Just learnt that the equation in point 1. is a quadratic one. For a 4-dimensional Mandelbrot set, we need a cubic equation with the same logic. Shall test it soon.


### Notes
---------
Following recipes need to be covered soon.
1. 4-dimensional Mandelbrot fractal 
2. Julia set and its fractal images
